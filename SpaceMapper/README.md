# SpaceMapper

- This is a great new app to help beings of all kinds find their public transport route from one planet to another
- This involves integrating lots of third party libraries and APIs
- They mostly come with types, but we might need to change the data format to suit our needs

### THE CHALLENGE
1) Check your VS Code is set up for TypeScript - you should see an error on test.ts
2) Open SpaceMapper.ts, and replace each `any` to complete all the challenges
