# Ewokr

- This is my hot new business idea - a dating app for Ewoks!
- I can't code very well though, so I need some hotshot devs to tidy this up, and add some Typescript, which I hear is the new cool thing.
- I've only just starting listing all the different fur types, I'd like this to be a list of unique references, so it doesn't get messy as the list grows.

### The rules of Ewok dating
- Patterned Ewoks are very fussy, they only ever like other patterned Ewoks.
- Otherwise each ewok can have a fur preference.
- Some open minded Ewoks like to date Wookies, but only if they share the same favourite food.
- Sometimes droids like to dress up as ewoks to go on dates as Ewoks

### THE CHALLENGE
1) Check your VS Code is set up for TypeScript - you could see an error on test.ts
2) Rename star-wars-dating.js to .ts
3) Create an `Ewok` type and a `Wookie` type
4) Type the `ewokCompatibilityChecker` function and investigate / fix any errors
5) Change the fur types object into an enum, as use the enum name as a type
6) Use both `in` and `is` to create a isWookie helper function that will help TypeScript understand if the potential date is a Wookie
7) Create an `EwokDroid` type, and allow it as an option for the `ewokCompatibilityChecker` function
8) Use the `as` keyword to deal with any errors that arise
